BUGS:
-------------------------------------------------------------
 Windows port:
   - Crashes early during ft.
   - No date/time in log-file.
   - Crashes in ssl context when starting up.
   v Backslash in config-file / path (interperated as escape by boost)
   - Ascii APPE is broken (fails FT)
   - FT for dir-listings fails because we miss . and .. entries

REFACTORING:
-------------------------------------------------------------
 - Remove CanSeeHiddenDirs() permission - not used
 - Make a better file-system iterator, add begin(), end() to Path


UNIT TESTS
-------------------------------------------------------------


FUNCTIONAL TESTS
-------------------------------------------------------------
 v Basic functional tests to verify commands, authorzation and authentication
 - Test AUTH after TLS is established
 - Session timeout
 - Transfer timeout
 - Long-running transfer to verify that session-timeout is not triggered
 - Bogus commands
 - Very long command-name
 - Very long paths
 - Simulate a typical session with some dir, upload, download. Run it several times in parallell.
 - Test access to non-recursive dir (and below it, where parent perms applies)

            -l (long format - default)
    v MLSD
    v MLST
    v Make sure MLSx always use BINARY transfers

    v MDTM
    v NLST
    v PASV
    v STAT
    v Fix buffer manipulation in WfdeFtpSession.cpp:121 / FIXME
    v Deal with session time-out
    v Deal with transfer time-outs (and sessioon to during transfer)
 v Add functional test suite (python?)
    v Configure the server trough conf-files (to get permissions/paths right)
    v Create the required test-files (different sizes)
    v Check [almost] all commands
    v Upload and download and verify hashes that the files are correctly transferred.
    v Check that REST and APPE works
 v Add more unit tests
 v Add auth manager
 v Add auth commands
 v Add permissions to the user and merge it upon login
 ~ Windows port
   v Test without TLS
   - Add "." and ".." for directory listings
   - Re-enable TLS
   - Add minidump-support
   - Add native service support
   - Add protection againts exploits trough "magic" file names (like "con")

ROADMAP:
-------------------------------------------------------------
 v Implement the FTP protocol
    v Add welcome and auth commands
    v Add auth manager
    v Add session manager
    v Add common transfer commands
    v Add file listing (ls)
    v Add rest, unique and friends
    v Add ACSII transfer
    v Add new file listing format
    v Add obscure commands
 v Add configuration files to wfded
 - Check the bind issue in WfdeFtpSession.cpp:611
 v Add a simple authentication manager (conf-file based)
 v Implement WfdeSesion::OnHousekeeping() - timeout sessions
 v Prepare the code for public release
 v Finish authentication
 v Make sure that all unit tests and performance tests are OK
 == RELEASE ALPHA PREVIEW
 - Use tools to test for known FTP vulnerabilities
 - Deal with PORT and PASV connection establishment time-out (today they will time out with the session)
 - Add TLS support
    v WfdeSocket for async operations
    v WfdeSocket for CC
    v WfdeSocket for transfers
    v Add TLS socket (transition from normal socket) (Not possible / using TL:S sockets for everything)
    v Add AUTH command & friends
    v Add PROT command and encrypted transfers
        v Enable TLS for PORT mode
        v Enable TLS for PASV mode
    - Add config for certs
    - Allow the server to enforce TLS (config)
    ~ Add functional tests for FTPS
        v Control Channel
        v Transfers
        - Double AUTH
        - Transfer with and without Transfer Encryption
