WFDE is built using cmake. 

Supported compilers:
  clang++ 3.5
  g++ 4.9
  Visual Studio 2015 CTP 5


This project depends on warlib (for logging, error-handling and the thread-pool).

The cmake-file assumes that the directory "../warlib' exists and that it's
libraries are compiled.

Personally, I use Kdevelop with both projects, "warlib" and "wfde", opened.

Warlib is available here:

  The warlib project is here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/warlib/

To clone it:
  git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/warlib/warlib warlib


Please use the project-page at Sourceforge for bug-reports, questions and
suggestions: http://sourceforge.net/projects/wfde/
